This is a fork of [Simple Machines Forum](https://www.simplemachines.org) version 2.1.  I forked this release for the purposes
 of running a heavily-modified version for my own purposes (specifically [languish.org](http://languish.org)).

If you wish to examine or fork the actual SMF software, please see
[the project repository](https://github.com/SimpleMachines/SMF2.1/).  This version is not going to track the 2.1
release, is going to diverge at some point, and may include significant incompatible changes.  Most notably, I have
removed (or will remove) everything associated with installation since I am installing this manually on my oen server.
